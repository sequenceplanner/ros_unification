# ros_unification

So, current status is as follows, some things are not done yet but these days they will...

Messages, I think they are now defined well, see msg folder. SP gets back the commands in the message for insight...
Scene Master Nodes, there will be a total of 5, some are done, some are not yet. Have to work with the MiR a bit...
Dummy Driver Nodes, none are done, but they will for testing purposes...

Unification Driver Nodes, some are done, some are not yet, but the general idea is to have a timeout of a few seconds
so that SP can have insight that the unidriver node is getting any messages from SP or somebody else. If no message is received in 
a few seconds, all bool types in the message go to False, and all other types go to Empty or 0... (see aecu, recu and hecu unidrivers
they are done and work as planned).

launch filse will be made for launching the real-life scenario and for the dummy scenario...

Haven't decided yet if we'll show the MiR simulation in Rviz, maybe just update a collision object in the scene instead based on the
real MiR's position. It seems too much to run Gazebo (comp. heavy) to simulate one movement of the MiR Robot, might compromise robustness...

node killer and ressurector skipped, now SP can have direct insight from the messages and choose to kill and resurrect nodes...

Excel and pdf file included provide insight for the developers...

More updates tomorrow,
Best, E
